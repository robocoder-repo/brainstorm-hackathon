# Brainstorm: A Neuroscience Hackathon for High School Students

## Project Name
Brainstorm: Neuroscience Innovation Challenge

## Elevator Pitch
Empower high school students to explore the frontiers of neuroscience through an exciting virtual hackathon. Brainstorm challenges participants to develop innovative solutions, create educational platforms, and engage in brain-stimulating activities while networking with like-minded peers.

## About the Project

### Inspiration
Brainstorm was inspired by the growing interest in neuroscience among high school students and the need for accessible, engaging STEM education opportunities. We aim to bridge the gap between cutting-edge neuroscience research and young, curious minds.

### What We Learned
Through organizing this hackathon, we've discovered:
- The importance of hands-on, project-based learning in neuroscience education
- The power of combining neuroscience with other disciplines like computer science and engineering
- The enthusiasm of high school students for tackling complex neuroscience challenges

### How We Built It
Brainstorm was developed by a team of neuroscientists, educators, and tech experts. We created a virtual platform that allows students to:
1. Collaborate on innovative neuroscience projects
2. Access resources and mentorship from experts in the field
3. Participate in brain-stimulating games and activities
4. Learn about the ethics of neuroscience technology

### Challenges We Faced
- Designing a virtual environment that fosters genuine collaboration and networking
- Balancing the complexity of neuroscience topics with accessibility for high school students
- Incorporating ethical considerations into neuroscience innovation challenges

## Built With
- Python (for data analysis and visualization)
- JavaScript (for interactive web components)
- React (for the main hackathon platform)
- TensorFlow (for machine learning components in neuroscience projects)
- OpenBCI (for brain-computer interface demonstrations)
