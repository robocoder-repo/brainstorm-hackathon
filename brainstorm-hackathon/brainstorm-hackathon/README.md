# Brainstorm Neuroscience Hackathon

This project demonstrates various components of a neuroscience hackathon platform.

## Project Structure

- `backend/`: FastAPI backend for data processing and API endpoints
- `frontend/`: React frontend for the main hackathon platform
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for interactive neuroscience tutorials
- `ml_models/`: TensorFlow models for machine learning components

## Setup and Running

1. Backend:
   - cd backend
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
   - python main.py

2. Frontend:
   - cd frontend
   - npm install
   - npm start

3. Notebooks:
   - jupyter notebook

4. ML Models:
   - cd ml_models
   - python simple_nn.py

## Note on OpenBCI

For brain-computer interface demonstrations, you would typically use OpenBCI hardware and their provided software. As this is a virtual environment, we haven't included actual OpenBCI code, but you could integrate it in a real-world scenario.
